SUMMARY
Particle swarm optimization is a population-based stochastic optimization technique that 
is easy to implement and has been successfully applied in many areas. 
However, its performance often deteriorates as the dimensionality of the problem increases.
Recently, parallel strategies based on multiple swarms (multi-swarm) have been investigated 
as an alternative to overcome this problem. In this paper, we evaluate
the impact of the topology on multi-swarm systems, considering that swarms are independent,
and interact by means of particle migration. We focus on asynchronous communication, that is, 
only when an improvement occurs on the best particle that the solution migrates among swarms.
The goal is to check how different communication strategies affect the parallel execution of 
the optimization tasks. Several different topologies and communication strategies have been evaluated,
including broadcast and gossip on fully connected networks, unidirectional and bidirectional rings,
hypercubes, and a dynamic topology. Extensive experimental results were obtained and are reported 
using several traditional benchmark functions. We evaluated the impact of the topologies in terms of 
the number of iterations and the communication overhead. With the results, a ranking of the different 
topologies is presented. The impact of the number of swarms on the optimization process is also evaluated.
